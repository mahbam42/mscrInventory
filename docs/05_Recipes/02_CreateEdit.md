# Creating or Editing Recipes

## Creating a New Recipe
1. Go to **Recipes → Manage Recipes**.  
2. Click **Add Recipe**.  
3. Enter the recipe **name**, **category**, and **base size** (typically Small / 12oz).  
4. Add ingredients by selecting them from the dropdown and entering quantities.  
5. Save the recipe.

## Editing an Existing Recipe
1. Navigate to **Manage Recipes**.  
2. Find the recipe and click **Edit (✎)**.  
3. Adjust ingredient amounts or add/remove components.  
4. Save changes.

## Copying Ingredients From Another Recipe
The UI does not include a one-click “Duplicate Recipe” button. Instead, use the **Extend Recipe** workflow inside the edit modal to copy ingredient lines:

1. Open the target recipe (or product) and click **Edit (✎)** to launch the recipe modal.
2. In the **Extend From Recipe** field, choose the source recipe whose ingredients you want to reuse (for example, a base latte or a seasonal variant).
3. Confirm the prompt to import the selected recipe’s ingredients into the current form.
4. Adjust quantities or remove any lines that do not apply, then save.

This copies the ingredient list into the current recipe while keeping the original unchanged. Editing a recipe immediately updates all linked products, so review quantities before saving.
