# Recipe Best Practices

- Recipes should be portioned to 12oz for Dynamic Scaling.  
- Avoid hardcoding multiple size versions — rely on scaling.  
- Audit ingredient costs regularly for accurate product pricing.   
- Archive recipes instead of deleting them.

**TIP:** Keep recipe names clear to support Square/Shopify import matching.
