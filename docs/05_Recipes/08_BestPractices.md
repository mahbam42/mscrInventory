# Recipe Best Practices

- Keep base sizes consistent for similar drinks.  
- Avoid hardcoding multiple size versions — rely on scaling.  
- Audit ingredient costs regularly for accurate product pricing.  
- Use **Duplicate** when creating seasonal variants.  
- Archive recipes instead of deleting them.

**TIP:** Keep recipe names clear to support Square/Shopify import matching.
