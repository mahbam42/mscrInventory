# Recipe Troubleshooting

### Scaling Seems Incorrect
- Check the recipe base size.  
- Review ingredient units for mismatches.

### Ingredient Missing from Dropdown
- Ensure the ingredient is **Active**.  
- Confirm its type is correct.

### Cost Doesn’t Update
- Re-save the recipe to trigger recalculation.

### Imported Items Not Matching Recipe

- Check for naming inconsistencies.
