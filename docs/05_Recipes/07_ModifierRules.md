# Edit Modifier Rules

The **Edit Modifier Rules** modal controls how a recipe responds to customizations.

### You can configure:
- Allowed modifiers  
- Replacement behavior (e.g., replace whole milk with oat milk)  
- Additive behavior (e.g., add 0.5 oz syrup)  
- Temperature rules (hot/iced logic)  
- Additional costs or upgrades  

Changes apply to all products linked to the recipe.

**CAUTION:** Incorrect modifier rules can create mismatches during imports.
