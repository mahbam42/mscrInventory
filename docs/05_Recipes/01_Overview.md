# Recipes Overview

Recipes define how ingredients combine to form products.  
Every product in the MSCR Inventory App is linked to a recipe, and recipe accuracy directly affects cost calculations, scaling, and modifier behavior.

Recipes are stored as structured ingredient lists with quantities, units, and optional modifier rules. Updates to a recipe immediately cascade to all linked products.

Key functions:
- Create new recipes  
- Edit existing ones  
- Scale ingredient ratios for multiple sizes  
- Extend Recipes from `'base_items'` 
- Configure modifier behavior
