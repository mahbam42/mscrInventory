# Ingredients Overview

Ingredients form the foundation of all recipes and products. Each ingredient record stores its name, type, unit of measure, unit cost, and optional descriptive fields such as roast level or bag size.

Ingredients must be maintained carefully, as they drive recipe accuracy, cost calculations, inventory counts, and reporting.

Key capabilities:
- Add, edit, or archive ingredients  
- Assign ingredient types  
- Track cost per unit  
- Associate packaging (cups, lids, sleeves, etc.)  
- Search and filter by category or status
