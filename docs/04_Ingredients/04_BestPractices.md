# Ingredient Best Practices

- Capitalize the first letter of each ingredient name.  
- Avoid brand names unless necessary.  
- Use consistent naming patterns (e.g., “Whole Milk (16oz)”).  
- Keep inactive or seasonal ingredients archived.  
- Audit ingredient costs regularly for accurate COGS.

**NOTE:** Consistent naming helps the importer match items correctly.
