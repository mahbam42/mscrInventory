# Manage Users

The **Manage Users** section allows managers and administrators to create, update, and organize user accounts within the MSCR Inventory App. User roles determine access to recipes, inventory, reports, and administrative tools.

This section centralizes:
- New user creation  
- Updating user information  
- Assigning or changing permission groups  
- Reviewing account status (active, pending, archived)  

Only users with elevated permissions (Manager or Admin) can access this area.
