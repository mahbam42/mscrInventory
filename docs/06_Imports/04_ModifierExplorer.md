# Modifier Explorer

The **Modifier Explorer** helps you analyze and standardize modifier behavior across imported data. It groups modifiers into categories based on how they match existing records.

Modifier categories include:

- **Known:** Clean matches to existing modifiers  
- **Alias:** Equivalent labels (e.g., “Oatmilk” → “Oat Milk”)  
- **Fuzzy Match:** Similar but not identical names  
- **Unknown:** Unrecognized or new modifiers  
- **Co-occurrence Pairs:** Common combinations that frequently appear together  

## What You Can Do in Modifier Explorer
- Review each category’s items  
- Assign aliases to unify inconsistent naming  
- Promote or demote modifiers  
- Identify missing variants in recipes or product setups  
- Export modifier insights as CSV for deeper analysis  

**TIP:** Resolve modifier inconsistencies before importing large batches to reduce unmapped items.
