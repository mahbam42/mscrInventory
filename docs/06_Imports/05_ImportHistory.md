# Import History

The **Import History** table provides a chronological view of all data imports across the system, including:

- Square CSV uploads  
- Shopify imports  
- Ingredient CSV imports  
- Inventory CSV adjustments  

Each entry displays:
- Timestamp  
- Source (Square/Shopify/CSV)  
- Run type (Dry Run or Live)  
- Count of created, updated, or skipped items  
- Links to warnings or unmapped items  

## When to Use Import History
- Audit previous import runs  
- Verify if a file was processed successfully  
- Confirm whether an issue came from Square or the Inventory App  
- Track changes over time  

Import History helps identify patterns such as:
- Repeated unmapped items  
- Inconsistent naming between systems  
- Products missing cost or ingredient data
