## Development Philosophy

The project continues to follow these principles:

- **Minimal Dependencies**  
  Simple, stable, maintainable tech stack.

- **Human-Centric Workflows**  
  Designed for baristas, supervisors, and managers—not engineers.

- **Transparent Operations**  
  CSV import/export always available as a fallback or manual override.

- **Incremental Enhancements**  
  Each release focuses on refining the real workflows used daily.

## Summary

The MSCR Inventory App aims to provide:
- A deeply reliable inventory and recipe system  
- Dead-simple daily workflows  
- Strong integrations  
- Extremely low long-term cost  
- Flexibility for any café or specialty drinks environment  

This roadmap ensures that the system continues improving while preserving its core strengths: accuracy, clarity, and efficiency.
