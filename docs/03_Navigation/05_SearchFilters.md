# Search and Filters

Use the global search or per-table filters to locate items quickly. Filters may be combined—for example, searching by name *and* narrowing by ingredient type.

**NOTE:** Filters persist between navigation actions until manually cleared.

When working with large inventories or recipe libraries, filters significantly reduce the time needed to locate and update records.
