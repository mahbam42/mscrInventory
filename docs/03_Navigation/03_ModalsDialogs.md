# Modals and Dialogs

Most actions occur through modal dialogs instead of full page reloads, which keeps the workflow fast and focused.

### Common Modal Types

- **Add / Edit Modals:** Create or edit ingredients, recipes, products, and inventory entries.  
- **Unmapped Items Modal:** Displays unresolved import entries requiring manual review.  
- **Edit Modifier Rules Modal:** Manage allowed modifiers, replacements, and pricing behavior.  
- **Confirmation Dialogs:** Appear before deleting or overriding data.

**TIP:** Always complete or cancel a modal before navigating elsewhere to avoid losing unsaved changes.
