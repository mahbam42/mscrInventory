# Color and Icon Conventions

The app uses consistent visual language to indicate the status of items:

| **Color / Icon** | **Meaning** |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Red** | Error or required attention (unmapped, missing data, low stock). |
| **Yellow** | Pending review or incomplete information. |
| **Green** | Successfully saved or verified. |
| **Blue “+” icon** | Add a new record. |
| **Edit (✎)** | Edit an existing entry. |

These conventions appear consistently across tables, forms, and dashboards.
