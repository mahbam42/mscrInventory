# Dashboard Layout

The **Dashboard** is the landing page after login. It summarizes recent activity and highlights key areas that may require attention.

- **Inventory Summary:** Displays total ingredient count and alerts for low-stock or unmapped items.  
- **Recent Imports:** Shows the latest CSV, Square, or Shopify import sessions with timestamps and status indicators.  
- **Quick Actions Panel:** Shortcuts for adding ingredients, updating recipes, or opening import modals.  
- **Search Bar:** Filters items by name, type, or category throughout the app.  
- **Notifications Banner:** Displays system messages, successful saves, or warnings about incomplete data.  

**NOTE:** Items highlighted in red indicate missing data or mapping conflicts. Clicking an item opens its detail view.
