# Exporting Reports

All major reports (usage, COGS, inventory, product summaries) can be exported as CSV files.

## Export Workflow
1. Open a report (Usage, COGS, Inventory, etc.)  
2. Apply filters as needed  
3. Click **Export CSV**  
4. Save the file to your system  

## CSV Uses
- External analysis (Excel, Google Sheets)  
- Accounting reconciliation  
- Historical archiving  
- Sharing with managers or auditors  

**NOTE:** Numerical precision is preserved in exported files (e.g., decimals for costs and ingredient units).
