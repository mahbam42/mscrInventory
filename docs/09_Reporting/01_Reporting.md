# Reporting

The **Reporting** module provides visibility into ingredient usage, cost of goods (COGS), inventory valuation, and operational insights across your café or retail environment. These reports help managers make data‑driven decisions regarding purchasing, pricing, inventory, and recipe management.

Reporting pulls from:
- Ingredient records  
- Recipe structures  
- Inventory stock entries  
- Order histories  
- Square and Shopify imports  

Accurate reporting depends on clean recipes, well‑maintained ingredients, and properly resolved imports.
