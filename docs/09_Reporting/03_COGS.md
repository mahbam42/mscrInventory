# Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)

The COGS report provides estimated ingredient cost per product sold over time.

## How COGS Is Computed
1. Pull ingredient costs from the Inventory module  
2. Apply recipe ingredient quantities  
3. Apply size scaling  
4. Add modifier cost effects  
5. Aggregate totals across orders  

## Why COGS Matters
- Helps refine menu pricing  
- Highlights low‑margin products  
- Identifies cost inefficiencies  
- Supports financial reporting  

**CAUTION:** If ingredient costs are outdated, COGS results will be inaccurate. Update costs regularly.
