## When to Choose a Commercial Tool Instead

- If you have multi‑unit corporate purchasing teams needing standardized PO systems.  
- If accounting/AP is your primary goal rather than recipe accuracy.

## Summary

mscrInventory excels in:
- cafés with custom drink workflows  
- environments with many modifiers or seasonal items  
- teams that want direct control over ingredients and recipes  
- operations where cost and accuracy matter more than big‑vendor ecosystems  

Commercial platforms may excel for:
- large multi‑unit operations  
- accounting‑heavy workflows  
- organizations needing AP automation  

Each option suits different needs, but **mscrInventory** offers exceptional flexibility, cost savings, and precision for ingredient‑driven cafés.
