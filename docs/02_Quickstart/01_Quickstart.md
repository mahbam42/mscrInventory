## Notes & Best Practices

**NOTE:** Changes to a recipe immediately update all products that use that recipe.

**CAUTION:** Avoid deleting ingredients that are used in recipes or products — deletion can break linked data. Use **Archive** instead.

**TIP:** Use consistent naming conventions. For example—  
*“Whole Milk (16oz)”* is easier for the importer to match than *“Milk - Whole Large Bag”*.

## Recommended Daily Flow

1. **Log in and check dashboard alerts**  
   Low-stock warnings, unmapped items, recent changes.

2. **Review inventory adjustments**  
   Enter new stock from deliveries or update depleted ingredients.

3. **Check product and recipe accuracy**  
   Ensure new items imported from Square or Shopify are mapped correctly.

4. **Look for cost discrepancies**  
   Ingredients with unusual cost shifts may require updates.

5. **Review orders (optional)**  
   Use the Orders Dashboard to review trends, especially custom/named drinks.
